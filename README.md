Lunacy
======

a simple, lightweight center-mode carousel plugin for jQuery

### Setup

Snag the minified JS and CSS, along with the font files for the arrows. Then, call Lunacy like so:

    $("#container").lunacy();
    
More info on options forthcoming; hopefully that will include a demo page soon.

### Why is it called Lunacy?

Because I decided to scrap the script I was using at the 11th hour of a project and write this, which was lunacy.
